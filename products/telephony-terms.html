These Terms of Service constitute the agreement ("Agreement") between Vision Systems, LLC and its affiliates ("we," "us" or "Vision") and the user ("you," "user" or "Customer") of Vision's residential and small business communications services and any related products or services ("Service"). This Agreement governs both the Service and any devices, such as an IP phone, Multimedia Terminal Adapter, Analog Telephone Adapter or any other IP connection device ("Device" or "Equipment"), used in conjunction with the Service. If you purchased Equipment from a retail store, dealer or other provider other than Vision, you are a "Retail Customer" for purposes of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
BY ACTIVATING OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU REPRESENT THAT YOU ARE OF LEGAL AGE TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT YOU HAVE READ AND UNDERSTAND FULLY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
</p>
<p>
1. EMERGENCY SERVICES - 911 DIALING<br>
1.1 Non-Availability of Traditional 911 or E911 Dialing Service.
 The Service does not support traditional 911 or E911 access to emergency services in all locations. Where traditional 911 or E911 access are NOT available you shall inform any household residents, guests and other third persons who may be present at the physical location where you utilize the Service of the non-availability of traditional 911 or E911.
</p>
<p>

1.2 How Emergency Personnel are Contacted. <br>
We contract with a third party to use the address of your registered location to determine the nearest emergency response center and then forward your call to a general number at that center. When the center receives your call, the operator may not have your address and may not have your phone number. You must therefore provide your address and phone number in order to get help. Some local emergency response centers may decide not to have their general numbers answered by live operators 24 hours a day. If we learn that this is the case, we will send your call instead to a national emergency calling center and a trained agent will contact an emergency center near you to dispatch help. You hereby authorize us to disclose your name and address to third-party service providers, including, without limitation, call routers, call centers and public service answering points, for the purpose of dispatching emergency services personnel to your registered location.
</p>
<p>

1.3 Service Outages. <br>
(a) Service Outages Due to Power Failure or Disruption.  911 Dialing does not function in the event of a power failure or disruption.  If there is an interruption in the power supply, the Service, including 911 dialing, will not function until power is restored. Following a power failure or disruption, you may need to reset or reconfigure the Device prior to utilizing the Service.
(b) Service Outages Due to Internet Outage or Suspension or Termination of Broadband Service or ISP Service.  Service outages or suspensions or terminations of service by your broadband provider or ISP will prevent all Service, including 911 dialing, from functioning.
(c) Service Outage Due to Suspension or Termination of your Vision Account. Service outages due to suspension or termination of your account will prevent all Service, including 911 dialing, from functioning.
(d) Service Outages Due to ISP or Broadband Provider Blocking of Ports or Other Acts. Your ISP or broadband provider or other third party, if other then Vision, may intentionally or inadvertently block the ports over which the Service is provided or otherwise impede the usage of the Service. In that event, provided that you alert us to this situation, we will attempt to work with you to resolve the issue. During the period that the ports are being blocked or your Service is impeded, and unless and until the blocking or impediment is removed or the blocking or impediment is otherwise resolved, your Service, including the 911 dialing feature, may not function. You acknowledge that Vision is not responsible for the blocking of ports by third party ISP or broadband provider or any other impediment to your usage of the Service, and any loss of service, including 911 dialing that may result. In the event you lose service as a result of blocking of ports or any other impediment to your usage of the Service, you will continue to be responsible for payment of the Service charges unless and until you terminate the Service in accordance with this Agreement.
(e) Other Service Outages. If there is a Service outage for any reason, such outage will prevent all Service, including 911 dialing, from functioning. Such outages may occur for a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, those reasons described elsewhere in this Agreement.
</p>
<p>

1.4 Network Congestion; Reduced Speed for Routing or Answering 911 dialing Calls. <br>
 There may be a greater possibility of network congestion and/or reduced speed in the routing of a 911 dialing call made utilizing the Service as compared to traditional 911 dialing over traditional public telephone networks.
</p>
<p>

1.5 Possible Lack of Automatic Number Identification. <br>
It may or may not be possible for the local emergency personnel to automatically obtain your phone number when you use 911 dialing. Our system is configured to send the automatic number identification information; however, one or more telephone companies, not us, route the traffic to the emergency response center and that center may not be capable of receiving and passing on that information. As a result, the operator who answers your 911 dialing call may not be able to automatically obtain your phone number and call you back if the call is not completed or is not forwarded, is dropped or disconnected, if you are unable to speak to tell the operator your phone number, or if the Service is not operational for any reason.
</p>
<p>

1.6 No Automated Location Identification. <br>
 In most service areas, it is not possible at this time to transmit to the local emergency response center the address that you registered for 911 dialing. You will need to state the nature of your emergency promptly and clearly, including your location (and possibly your telephone number), as you must assume the operator will not have this information. Emergency personnel will not be able to find your location if the call is not completed or is not forwarded, is dropped or disconnected, if you are unable to speak to tell the operator your location, or if the Service is not operational for any reason.
</p>
<p>

1.7 Disclaimer of Liability and Indemnification. <br>
We do not have any control over whether, or the manner in which, calls using our 911 dialing service are answered or addressed by any local emergency response center. We disclaim all responsibility for the conduct of local emergency response centers and the national emergency calling center. We rely on third parties to assist us in routing 911 dialing calls to local emergency response centers and to a national emergency calling center. We disclaim any and all liability or responsibility in the event such third party data used to route calls is incorrect or yields an erroneous result. Neither Vision nor its officers or employees may be held liable for any claim, damage, or loss, and you hereby waive any and all such claims or causes of action, arising from or relating to our 911 dialing service unless such claims or causes of action arose from our gross negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct. You shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Vision, its officers, directors, employees, affiliates and agents and any other service provider who furnishes services to you in connection the Service, from any and all claims, losses, damages, fines, penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, attorneys fees) by, or on behalf of, you or any third party relating to the absence, failure or outage of the Service, including 911 dialing, incorrectly routed 911 dialing calls, and/or the inability of any user of the Service to be able to use 911 dialing or access emergency service personnel.
</p>
<p>

1.8 Alternate 911 Arrangements. If you are not comfortable with the limitations of the 911 dialing service, you should consider having an alternate means of accessing traditional 911 or E911 services or terminating the Service.
</p>
<p>

2. SERVICE<br>
2.1 Term. Service is offered on a monthly basis for a term that begins on the date that Vision activates your Service and ends on the day before the same date in the following month. Subsequent terms of this Agreement automatically renew on a monthly basis unless you give us written notice of non-renewal at least ten (10) days before the end of the monthly term in which the notice is given. Unless you have made prior arrangements in advance, You are purchasing the Service for full monthly terms, meaning that if you attempt to terminate Service prior to the end of a monthly term, you will be responsible for the full month's charges to the end of the then current term, including, without limitation, unbilled charges, plus a termination fee, if applicable, all of which will immediately become due and payable. You will also be responsible for the next full month's charges in the event that you do not provide the requisite ten days notice of termination prior to the expiration of the then-current term. Expiration of the term or termination of Service will not excuse you from paying all accrued and unpaid charges due under this Agreement
